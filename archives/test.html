<h3>Which routes, stations and OMF North locations should we keep studying?</h3>
<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis: 66.66%;">
<p>Below are key station area features and findings from our most recent<br>evaluation for the current route, station and OMF North alternatives. We<br>need public input to help determine which should move forward. The project<br>team may need to study multiple alternatives in an EIS, so your comments<br>will help us narrow down which options should be studied in the EIS and<br>which is the preferred alternative.</p>
<h4>What criteria are studied in our evaluation?</h4>
<p>We are studying various aspects of the project and the potential positive<br>and negative effects that route, station and OMF North alternatives could<br>have on a surrounding area. The criteria studied cover a range of topics,<br>including technical and financial feasibility, preliminary comparative<br>cost estimates and potential impacts to natural, built, and social<br>environments.</p>
<p>The findings from our evaluation listed below are focused on differences<br>in the alternatives’ performance. Ridership and proximity to Puget Sound Regional Council-designated centers, for example, were studied as part of our analysis; however, these criteria were not found to be notably different between station locations, therefore they are not included below. If you are interested in more information about all of the criteria we measured and the results, you can find them in the Level 2 Evaluation Report.</p>
<h4>How to view</h4>
<p>You can learn more about an area by clicking the area name below. From<br>there, you can learn about specific alternatives by clicking their names.</p>

  <div class="sr-only">The text below describes the image above Map of the Everett Link Extension project area. The representative project parallels Interstate Five and continues north from Lynnwood City Center station on an elevated guideway, with a station in West Alderwood. The route continues on an elevated guideway to the next station located at the Ash Way Park and Ride. From Ash Way, the route moves northward on tracks that are surface level with the road, shifting to an elevated platform again as the train approaches Mariner Station, where additional parking is proposed. From Mariner station, the route continues on an elevated guideway in a northwest direction, with a provisional station located at state route ninety-nine and Airport Road. The route continues northwest on an elevated guideway and gradually comes to surface level tracks as it enters a station near state route five two six, known as the Southwest Everett Industrial Center. The route then moves east on an elevated guideway and enters the next station on surface level tracks at state route five two six and Evergreen Way. From here, the route has mixed elevated and surface level guideways that move northward, paralleling interstate five. The final station is on an elevated guideway at the existing Everett station in downtown Everett. Additional parking is proposed at the Everett station.

This map shows four Operation and Maintenance Facility, OMF for short, location alternatives alongside the Representative Route. The OMF Site Location alternatives are symbolized by purple shapes and the Representative Route is indicated by a pink line. The Representative Route runs adjacent to interstate 5 south and turns west alongside State Route 526. The first OMF Site Location alternative is at the intersection of state route 526 and Hardeson Road followed by another OMF Site Location Alternative at the intersection of 80th street SW and 16th Avenue. The Representative Route turns south at Airport Road, and another OMF Alternative Site Location is at the intersection of Airport Road and 100th Street southwest as the Route travels on Airport Road directly east of Paine Field. An additional OMF Site Location Alternative is located at the intersection of state route 99 and Gibson Road as the Representative Route veers southeast, following the curve of Airport Road as it turns into 128th Street southwest. The Representative Route follows 128th street southwest and curves through the Mariner Park-and-Ride to follow the course of interstate 5 South.">

Its east edge does not run adjacent to a road. The northeast corner fits into the intersection of 75th street southwest and Hardeson road.In the bottom left of the graphic another of the OMF site location alternatives is shown as a triangle with rounded points. The site alternative’s north edge runs adjacent to no roads, the west edge runs adjacent to Airport Road, the southern tip runs adjacent to Holly drive, and the eastern edge runs adjacent to 21st avenue west, but only in the northeast corner.
